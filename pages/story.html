  <h2>Story</h2>

  <p class=intro>Written by Alex Cuthburt</p>
  <div class=spacer></div>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p class = story>The myth of the Psychopomp and of the land between life and death has been around for thousands of years, as long as humans have lived and wondered what happens to them when they die. No one quite knows exactly what this space between looks like though; those who have brushes with death never quite see it as it is, and the gaps in the narrative get embellished on cold winter nights around the fire, when storytellers and audiences don't have much else to do.
  <br>
  <br>
There are some commonalities between beliefs though - usually, souls start in the living world, pass through a liminal space, and end in some sort of afterlife or eternal reward. The middle of this journey is fraught with some sort of darkness or peril that must be overcome to reach the other side. This is the gap in between creations. The Fields of Asphodel, The Gunnungagap, Purgatory. The Netherworld that Ra sails his Sun Barge through, ferrying the dead to be judged like Charon of Greek Mythology. There are many stories and many names attached to this place.
  <br>
    <br>
We call it the In-Between.
</p>
<div class=spacer></div>
<h3>The In-Between</h3>
<p class = story>
Who are the people that roam the In-Between? Angels? The Fae? Valkyries? Demons or other spirits of the underworld? No matter what they may call themselves, they are the guardians that protect souls on their way to the other side. Not all are brave enough to make the journey though - the civilians tend to stay in cities and towns close to one side or the other, where it's lighter and the wards guarding the settlements are the strongest.
  <br>  <br>
The Darkness hasn't been a real threat for a long time. The paths from one city to another are lit by shrines of protection; streetlamps, or lighthouses against the shadows, powered by the Souls passing by them. But - the Shepherds in recent times have grown lazy, and often fail to reinforce the shrines as they make their journeys.
Stopping would take time, you see, and moving faster means more sheep are delivered.
  <br>  <br>
Leaving the shrines to burn out however, gave the Darkness all the opportunity it needed to find a way in.
  </p>
  <div class=spacer></div>
  <h3>The Darkness</h3>
  <p class = story>
In to the world, in to the paths, in near the sheep, and into the Shepherds' hearts. Those that neglected the light of the shrines soon found themselves growing colder, turning darker, until that darkness overtook them and they gave in to become beings of teeth and hunger.
  <br>  <br>
The Wolves in Shepherds' clothing could no longer receive flocks of their own - they can't enter the towns after all - but more Shepherds would soon be on their way with fresh sheep. All they would have to do is wait.
  <br>  <br>
When the game starts, the Shepherd has collected a small group of sheep on the mortal side of the In-Between and sets off on his way. The town is bright and well-lit, though there is no clear Sun in the sky. As he leaves the gates you can see big braziers being tended by their keepers; these are the soul shrines that protect the city. The sky darkens the further away he walks into the wilderness, until the brightest lights around are the sheep, the Shepherd's staff, and the shrines along the path. Once or twice he encounters a shrine that isn't lit, and lights it to keep the path safe for the Shepherds coming along after him.
  </p>
  <div class=spacer></div>
  <h3>The Game</h3>
  <p class = story>
The shrines start to worry him. They ought to be lit. It isn't safe to traverse the In-Between without them, it's too Dark.
  <br>  <br>
And then he is ambushed. The Wolf pounced on him from behind and the blow was enough to knock him unconscious when his head hit the ground.
  <br>  <br>
He wakes sometime later to one of his two remaining sheep nudging him. The rest are scattered or taken by the Wolves.
  <br>  <br>
And so the game begins - Find more sheep, your sheep, if you can. Avoid the Wolves. Bring your flock to the other side of the In-Between, and light as many shrines as you can along the way to push back the Darkness.</p>
